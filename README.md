## Methodology

We will create some issues in the repository and the members will discuss about the issue and resolve.

Some simple Rules:
- Never push directly to master, always create a merge request.
- Always wait for your merge request to be accepted, if needed, you may request an earlier code-review.

1. Run `git pull origin master`
2. Create another branch with `git checkout -b Name_New_branch`
3. Resolve or create the feature and commit in this branch
4. At end, create the Pull/Merge Request for the master branch and wait

## Future

We can think about the performance, automation of tasks like optmization of images or minification of files.

We can move the project to a framework like React, Sapper or Vue

## Deployment

In this moment, the site is hospeded by the gitHub Pages.
We have to think and deploy in our self server.
