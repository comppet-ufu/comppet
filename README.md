## Methodology

We will create some issues in the repository and the members will discuss about the issue and resolve.

**Some simple Rules:**
- Never push directly to master, always create a merge request.
- Always wait for your merge request to be accepted, if needed, you may request an earlier code-review.

**The sequence to fix a issue or add a feature:**
1. Run `git pull origin master`
2. Create another branch with `git checkout -b Name_New_branch`
3. Resolve or create the feature and commit in this branch
4. Create the Pull/Merge Request for the master branch and wait

## In the Future

We can talk about performance and automation of tasks like optmization of images or minification of files.

We can move the project to a framework like React, Sapper or Vue.

## Deployment

In this moment, the site is hospeded by the gitHub Pages.
We have to analyze and deploy in our self server.
